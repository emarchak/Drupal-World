#The Game Plan

## Combat
HP is replaced with Productivity. A player has so much productitiy, and once that's at zero they're no longer able to contribute to the team. Their team can help bring back their productivity, but it's costly.

Moves are replaced with tasks, and are focused on targeting specific user stories that utilize your skills. A task could be completing SSO integration, gathering information from a client or ordering take out for the rest of the team.

## Equipment
Equipment helps buff moves, and it can be either physical or mental. A second monitor, a Dvorak keyboard, or access to a dev IRC channel buffs their tasks allowing them to to quickly complete a task.

## APIs
The world of developers is a fantastical place, as tasks that would normally be impossible to take on for one developer can be quickly completed using APIs. Using APIs come from many years of training and dedication. This replaces magic.

## Projects
Projects are what make you a team of developers, not just a random assortment of people. You will always have at least one bond, and youâ€™ll often have more.

## Alignment 
Remains the same as in dungeon world, because that's hilarious.

* **Lawful**
   * Uphold semantic programming
   * Fulfill a claimed task
   * Choose team cohesion over personal gain
* **Good**
   * Ignore loss of personal productivity to teach another
   * Reveal a logic error
   * Take a task that isn't to your strength to help the team
   * Communicate openly to a client
* **Neutral**
   * Take tasks that only cater to your strength
   * Give white lies to a client
   * No strong preference over APIs
* **Chaotic**
   * Access to all APIs
   * Use unsemantic programming for speed
   * Drop claimed tasks that get in the way of completing a project
* **Evil**
   * Willingly deceive a client
   * Hack a systems core to complete a project on time
   * Ignore security issues for sake of speed
   * Upset the rightful order
   

## Monsters & Dungeons
Dungeons are replaced by unsurmountable projects. Monsters are replaced with individual user stories. Each user story as a complexity rating, which is mapped to the traditional health points. Each task a player successfully completes

# Classes
Classes are to be roughly mapped as such: 

| Source | Target | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Bard   | Graphic Designer | Their work inspires others to complete stories |
|  | Front-end Developer | 
| Fighter | Back-end Developer |
| Wizard | API Specialist | They are able to complete un-surmountable stories quickly, but it must meet their speciality |
| Rogue | Product Owner | Assists the team in identifying user stories, and potential productivity pitfalls |
| Cleric | Scrum Master | They can re-energize players whose productivity is down |
